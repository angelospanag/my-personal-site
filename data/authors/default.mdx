## About me

Hello, I am Angelos, an Contractor Software Engineer currently collaborating with [Elsewhen](https://www.elsewhen.com/).

**Favourite languages/tools for software development?**

Mainly Go and Python for backend development and React/TypeScript for frontend development. This blog is [using Next.js](https://github.com/angelospanag/my-personal-site) with a [starter blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for automating its deployment.

**Other interests?**

I love listening to heavy metal and playing electric guitar, reading science-fiction and fantasy
books, PC gaming and especially RPGs, exercising/running.
