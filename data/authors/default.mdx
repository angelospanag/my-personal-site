## About me

Hello, I’m Angelos, a Software Engineer specializing in backend and frontend development.

**Favourite languages/tools for software development?**

I work mainly with Go and Python on the backend, and React/TypeScript on the frontend. This blog is [built with Next.js and Bun](https://github.com/angelospanag/my-personal-site), customized from a [starter template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for automated deployment.

**Other interests?**

I enjoy listening to heavy metal, playing electric guitar, reading science-fiction and fantasy, PC gaming (especially RPGs), and staying active through running and exercise.
