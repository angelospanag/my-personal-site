## Intro

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) has become one of my favourite minimalistic frontend libraries to use in combination with a FastAPI/Python project. The JavaScript/React fatigue is real.

This post will not be introducing HTMX from scratch, but rather mention an elegant way to avoid a common unwanted behaviour that you might face in your application, the accidental loading of partial pages which are normally intended as responses to an HTMX request.

## Setting up an example FastAPI app that serves templates containing HTMX

Supposedly you have a FastAPI backend that serves you a basic HTML page with some minimal CSS, a header "Sci-Fi Movies" and a button "Get movies table". A pretty basic page.

The HTML in `templates/index.html` looks as followed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.8.6"></script>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: #222;
        color: #fff;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      }

      table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
        margin: 20px auto;
        width: 80%;
      }

      th,
      td {
        padding: 10px;
        text-align: left;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
      }

      th {
        background-color: #333;
      }

      tr:nth-child(even) {
        background-color: #444;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sci-Fi Movies</h1>
    <button hx-get="/movies" hx-trigger="click" hx-target="#movies" hx-swap="outerHTML">
      Get movies table
    </button>
    <div id="movies"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The actual movies table can reside in an HTML file `templates/movies.html` as followed:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Director</th>
      <th>Release Year</th>
      <th>IMDb Rating</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Blade Runner</td>
      <td>Ridley Scott</td>
      <td>1982</td>
      <td>8.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The Matrix</td>
      <td>The Wachowskis</td>
      <td>1999</td>
      <td>8.7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Inception</td>
      <td>Christopher Nolan</td>
      <td>2010</td>
      <td>8.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interstellar</td>
      <td>Christopher Nolan</td>
      <td>2014</td>
      <td>8.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Avatar</td>
      <td>James Cameron</td>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>7.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

When the button is clicked, an HTMX GET call is performed against `/movies` which will fetch an HTML response containing movies rendered in a table, and replace the empty `div` with id `movies`. A very simple example that showcases the flexibility and terse syntax of HTMX.

```html
<button hx-get="/movies" hx-trigger="click" hx-target="#movies" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Get movies table
</button>
<div id="movies"></div>
```

The backend side of what we have done so far can be in a `main.py` file that looks like this:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Query, Request, status
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates

app = FastAPI()

templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")

@app.get("/movies", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def get_movies(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("movies.html", {"request": request})


@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def index(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("index.html", {"request": request})
```

The app works as intended. If we visit `http://localhost:8000/` and click the `Get movies table` button, we see the table loaded on the screen while the CSS styling is respected according to the rules defined in `index.html`.

## Why this setup could go wrong

If a user accidentally visits `http://localhost:8000/movies` then the template `movies.html` will load, which simply contains our raw HTML table with no styles defined. This page is effectively a partial that should only be loaded as a result of an HTMX call, not on its own.

## How can this be avoided

Regardless of your backend solution, you can [check that a request is coming from HTMX by checking for the existence of the `hx-request` header](https://htmx.org/docs/#request-header): `{'hx-request': 'true'}`. [FastAPI offers a very elegant dependency injection system](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/) which we can leverage for this exact purpose.

We can define a function `is_partial_rendering` which accepts the `Request` object of an HTTP call, accesses its headers, checks that a header `{'hx-request': 'true'}` exists, and continues with serving the request normally, otherwise it redirects the user with an HTTP status `307` to the root `/` endpoint of the FastAPI app.

That dependency in turn can be injected to our `/movies` endpoint as an argument with `_=Depends(is_partial_rendering)`.

```python
async def is_partial_rendering(request: Request):
    if "hx-request" in request.headers:
        if not request.headers["hx-request"]:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_307_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT,
                headers={"Location": "/"},
            )
    else:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_307_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT,
            headers={"Location": "/"},
        )

@app.get("/movies", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def get_movies(
    request: Request,
    _=Depends(is_partial_rendering),
):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("movies.html", {"request": request})
```

## Conclusion

A very simple but crucial trick that leverages Dependencies, one of the most useful features of FastAPI, and can be used to make a frontend codebase using HTMX more robust.
