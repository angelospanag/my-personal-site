## Intro

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a new performant JavaScript runtime and toolkit containing its own bundler, test runner and package manager, while aiming to be a drop-in replacement for existing projects using Node.js. At the time of writing it has reached version 1.0.2, and I had the chance to test it with some personal and work projects, including using it in combination with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in Docker containers.

So far I have been really impressed with its performance and its compatibility with existing projects. Below I am showing you how to containerise a Next.js project using Bun, with minimal changes from the official documentation.

## Installing Bun and scaffolding a new Next.js project

The official documentation offers many alternatives on [how to install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), the quickest is:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

After that, creating a new Next.js project is as easy as:

```bash
bunx create-next-app
```

## Containerising our new Next.js project

Vercel offers guidelines in their official documentation on [how to create a Docker image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#docker-image) along with [a sample repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker).

- First we need to modify the `next.config.js` file so that the build output can be `standalone`, [as shown in the official documentation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker#in-existing-projects).

  ```javascript
  // next.config.js
  module.exports = {
    // ... rest of the configuration.
    output: 'standalone',
  }
  ```

After that, we can reuse the existing example by making the following modifications in the [provided Dockerfile](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile):

- The official base image is defined as `FROM oven/bun AS base` and is released by [Oven, "the company behind Bun"](https://oven.sh/) in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun).

- `Bun` is using by default a binary lockfile `bun.lockb` [for performance](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install#manage-dependencies). In order to install a project's dependencies we need to copy first the `package.json` and the generated `bun.lockb` lockfile.

  ```dockerfile
  COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
  ```

- Installing using reproducible dependencies can be done with: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`

  ```dockerfile
  RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
  ```

- The build step can be run using: `bun run build`

  ```dockerfile
  RUN bun run build
  ```

- The base image is [creating a unix group called `bun`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/oven/bun/latest/images/sha256-54c2a56911da96e9493393621dd9193e918cab61d1359b0c786b9fb3a02db8a4?context=explore). We don't need to create a new separate group `nodejs` as it was done in the previous version of the Dockerfile. We only need to change the ownership of the generated files from the build step to `nextjs:bun`.

  ```dockerfile
  RUN chown nextjs:bun .next
  COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/standalone ./
  COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/static ./.next/static
  ```

- Finally, the server can be run with: `bun server.js`

  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["bun", "server.js"]
  ```

- Optionally, my personal preference is to disable the collection of anonymous telemetry during the build step and for the final produced Docker image.

  ```dockerfile
  ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
  ```

## Full Dockerfile

The full Dockerfile with the above changes can now be added to the root of the Next.js project and is as followed:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
# Disable telemetry during the build
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN bun run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

# Disable telemetry
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Set the correct permission for prerender cache
RUN mkdir .next
RUN chown nextjs:bun .next

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:bun /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

# Set hostname to localhost
ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"

CMD ["bun", "server.js"]
```

## Building the Docker image and running it as a container

As before, the image can be built and tagged using:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```

Finally, running a container of the image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```
