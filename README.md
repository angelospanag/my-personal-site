This blog is [using Next.js with Bun](https://github.com/angelospanag/my-personal-site), based on an [existing starter blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I’ve customized, and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for automating its deployment.

## Other interests?

I love listening to heavy metal and playing electric guitar, reading science-fiction and fantasy books, PC gaming and especially RPGs, exercising/running.
